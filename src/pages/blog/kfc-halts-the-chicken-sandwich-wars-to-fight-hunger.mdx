# KFC Halts the “Chicken Sandwich Wars” to Fight Hunger

<br />

KFC is calling for a truce among chicken sandwich sellers to fight hunger. On Giving Tuesday (November 30), KFC will donate $1 for each KFC Chicken Sandwich sold* (including KFC Chicken Sandwich meals) to Blessings in a Backpack to provide weekend meals to children who might otherwise go hungry. The organization was selected as the donation recipient by KFC restaurant team members. In addition to the donation to Blessings in a Backpack, KFC is challenging its competitors to join forces to donate to a deserving non-profit organization of their choice to fight hunger.
