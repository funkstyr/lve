## Company History

<br />

Luihn VantEdge Partners (LVE) has been growing ever since Allan and Donna founded Luihn Foods in 1966. What started as an opportunity to supplement his teaching income and support their family of four children has blossomed into a prosperous and growing business still rooted in those original family values.

<br />

The first KFC franchise they purchased in the mountains of North Carolina has evolved into a multi-branded business with over 150 locations in five states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Florida, and Arizona.   Focused always on the future, in 1993 Luihn Foods pioneered the Two-in-One concept between KFC and Taco Bell and has been involved in testing various other co-branding opportunities.  Now with Allanâ€™s son, CEO Jody Luihn, LVE is focused on aggressive plans for future expansion in high growth markets. In 2020, the Luihn family selected family office VantEdge to partner as Luihn VantEdge Partners on a major recapitalization with a goal of doubling in scale over the next five years.

<br />

Another strength of Luihn VantEdge Partners has always been its leadership. The company and its officers have been the recipients of numerous awards for their innovation, sales and contribution to the brands with which they come in contact. Officers of the company continue to be leaders, taking part in franchise advisory councils, helping to shape the future of the various LVE brands and act as a strong voice for franchisees everywhere.

<br />

This strong voice is backed by a wealth of talent. From the beginning staff of one store to over 3,000 employees today, each employee continues to make a difference. LVE enjoys providing talented employees with a forum that allows advancement and in which they can express their ideas and creativity. This combination of talent, ambition, focus and innovation continues to propel LVE forward to a success-filled future.

<br />

Through the growth that success brings and the change that accompanies it, LVE has remained true to its beginnings. To this day, the business that was built on family has not lost its roots.
