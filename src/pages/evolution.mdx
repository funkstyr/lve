## The Luihn Story

<br />

Founder Allan Luihn opened the first store in 1966, a KFC in Boone, NC.  More than 50 years later, Luihn VantEdge Partners now serves communities in five states from more than 150 locations. Through the growth that success brings and the change that accompanies it, LVE has remained true to its beginnings. To this day, the business that was built on family has not lost its roots.
