## LVE Cares

<br />

At Luihn VantEdge Partners, we care about each neighborhood that we are in. Every day, we donate food and support local charities and organizations both large and small.

<br />

## Spirit Nights

<br />

There are many organizations and schools that hold fundraisers at our restaurants throughout the year. Each organization receives 10% of sales for the time frame of their event. Please contact us 4-6 weeks prior to your event by sending an e-mail to [LFScares@luihnfood.com](mailto:LFScares@luihnfood.com) and we will do our best to help you with scheduling a Spirit Night at one of our many locations.
